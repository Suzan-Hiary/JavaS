    <h2> Operators</h2>
JavaScript has the following types of operators. This section describes the operators and contains information about operator precedence.

*ssignment operators
*Comparison operators
*Arithmetic operators
*Bitwise operators
*Logical operators
*String operators
*Conditional (ternary) operator
*Comma operator
*Unary operators
*Relational operators

    <h3>  Expressions </h3>
    
An expression is any valid unit of code that resolves to a value.

Every syntactically valid expression resolves to some value but conceptually, there are two types of expressions: with side effects (for example: those that assign value to a variable) and those that in some sense evaluate and therefore resolve to a value.

The expression x = 7 is an example of the first type. This expression uses the = operator to assign the value seven to the variable x. The expression itself evaluates to seven.

The code 3 + 4 is an example of the second expression type. This expression uses the + operator to add three and four together without assigning the result, seven, to a variable.

JavaScript has the following expression categories:

Arithmetic: evaluates to a number, for example 3.14159. (Generally uses arithmetic operators.)
String: evaluates to a character string, for example, "Fred" or "234". (Generally uses string operators.)
Logical: evaluates to true or false. (Often involves logical operators.)
Primary expressions: Basic keywords and general expressions in JavaScript.
Left-hand-side expressions: Left values are the destination of an assignment.

<script>
 
The assignment operator (=) assigns a value to a variable
for example:
var x = 10;

variables:
var username ="suzan";
console.log(username);
var age=40
if (age>=40){consol.log("what yours hoppy?")
;}else if(age<40){consol.log("what you are study?");}
